# FACIAL-VERIFICATION
Introduction
This project is a facial verification model built with Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The model leverages various machine learning and computer vision libraries to perform facial recognition and verification tasks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient system for verifying identities based on facial images.

Features
Facial Detection: Using OpenCV to detect faces in images.
Facial Verification: Utilizing TensorFlow to train and deploy a facial recognition model.
Visualization: Employing Matplotlib for visualizing the data and results.
User Interface: A simple interface for uploading images and getting verification results.
Libraries Used
OpenCV: For image processing and facial detection.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.
TensorFlow: For building and training the facial verification model.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
